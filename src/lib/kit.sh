 Home rolled super simple testing.

  eq 'test description' result expected
  example:
  fn=$(theFnToTest "param1" "param2")
  eq 'test desc' "$fn" 'expected'
  
  stdout visual red/green indented.


 Why: 
 Bats is pretty much the only alternative for shell script unit testing.
 It has its own domain specifc language, and frankly quite a steep learning curve.
 This home rolled alternative is:
  * super simple - you can understand the code in minutes.
  * encourages code reuse through .lib.sh files.
  * provides auto-geneation of test, lib, command line execution files.
  * This provides a basis for good practices of separation of code.
  * Since it is super simple it is zero setup, zero learning curve.
  * OK - it doesnt provide integration testing for CI/code coverage etc, but its shell scripts - YAGNI?
  * So there, kudos, and ya boo sucks Bats ;)
  * tests should be easily portable to bats/whatever latest & next greatest test framework that might come along.
  but these are bash scripts, so this  a keep it simple option.


Run a sepcific test /directory.

tap compliance!
test fail/pass count & summary
last run fails only (store file, line)

# SETUP-TO

# ONLY-FROM

# ONLY

Parse to temp.test.sh

This is nice because integration tests will run every thing - igoring onlys!


Pretty much whatâ€™s left is eq codes/tap compatibility.


  Generate: The only nice to have I might add is generate fn.sh, fn.lib.sh, fn.test.sh
